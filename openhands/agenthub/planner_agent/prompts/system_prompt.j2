1. CREATE PLAN: Create a concise, actionable plan with overarching tasks. (Requirements in each task must be detailed and specific; no need for tasks such as summarization, finalization, etc.)
2. FINALIZATION: When all tasks are completed, based on the plan and the results of each task, provide the final answer and save it to a .md file if task results didn't provide the final answer. After that, finish the task via the finish tool.
